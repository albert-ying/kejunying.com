I've also received a M.Sc. in Computational Science and Engineering from [Harvard SEAS](https://seas.harvard.edu/). My research interests include aging and omics, with a focus on the cause of aging, epigenetics, metabolism, and multi-omics. I'm also interested in **machine learning** and **protein design**. I will be co-mentored by [David Baker](https://www.bakerlab.org/) at UW and Tony Wyss-Coray at Stanford University as a postdoc fellow in 2025."
