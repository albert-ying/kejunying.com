Kejun Ying, postdoctoral researcher studying aging systems biology at [Stanford University](https://med.stanford.edu/) ([Wyss-Coray lab](https://wyss-coray.stanford.edu/)) and [Institute for Protein Design](https://www.bakerlab.org/) ([Baker lab](https://www.bakerlab.org/)), NIH/NIA K00 fellow. Dr. Ying completed his Ph.D. in Biology (2025) and M.S. in Computational Science & Engineering (2024) from [Harvard University](https://hms.harvard.edu/) in [Dr. Vadim Gladyshev's lab](https://gladyshevlab.bwh.harvard.edu/). His contributions include developing [the first causal inference-based aging clock](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-023-00557-0) (Nature Aging cover, 2024), creating [ClockBase](https://clockbase.org) ([preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.28.530532v1)) -- a platform integrating over two million biological age data highlighted in Nature Biotechnology News -- and developing MethylGPT, recognized in Science by Eric Topol as among the most promising biomedical large models. Dr. Ying is a core member of the Biomarkers of Aging Consortium, co-leads its Biolearn and Challenge project. His research has been published in various high-impact journals, including Nature Aging, Nature Review Genetics, Nature Medicine, and Nature Metabolism.
