<h2>后庭花破子·冬夜偶提</h2>
<p class="heti-verse">
寒星久靡靡，游烛漫欲熄。<br>

The poem "Hou Ting Hua Po Zi" (后庭花破子) expresses the author's melancholy and despair as he reflects on the passing of time and the challenges of aging on a cold winter night. The fading starlight ("寒星") and flickering candle ("游烛") symbolize the waning of life. The dew-covered "cui qiao" (翠翘, eyebrows) and withered flowers on the colorful garment ("残花附彩衣") represent the faded beauty of youth. The poet laments that the passing years have left him with an incurable ailment ("岁成疾"), perhaps referring to the emotional wounds and physical decline that come with age. For nine years ("九年"), he has been seeking a way to heal, but the search seems endless, leaving him wondering when, if ever, he will find relief ("待何日，方可医").

<h2>钗头凤·无题</h2>

In the untitled poem "Chai Tou Feng" (钗头凤), the author reflects on the tranquility and melancholy of autumn, while expressing a sense of regret and longing. The "qiu hua" (秋华, autumn splendor) is washed away, and the "qiu sheng" (秋声, autumn sounds) are silent. The river waves ("江浪") are gentle, the mountain mist ("山烟") is faint, and the moon hides behind the mast as the evening boat drifts leisurely. The pace is slow ("慢"), emphasizing the tranquility of the scene.

The author's heart is cleansed of worldly dust ("尘心洗") and has abandoned fleeting fame ("浮名弃"). They now recall the loneliness and detachment ("离索") of half a lifetime ("半生"). As the autumn rain subsides ("秋雨初歇"), new autumn feelings arise ("秋情新漫"). The poet's heart is filled with a sense of regret ("憾"), repeated three times to emphasize the depth of this emotion.

<h2>浣溪沙·皂衫薄</h2>
<p class="heti-verse">
绛帐无风日影灼 佳人慵起朱颜酡。<br>

In the poem "Huan Xi Sha" (浣溪沙), the author describes a sensual and intimate scene during the transition from spring to summer. Inside the crimson curtains ("绛帐"), there is no wind, and the sun's shadow is scorching ("日影灼"). The beautiful person ("佳人") is slow to rise, their rosy cheeks flushed ("朱颜酡"). Their cherry lips ("樱唇") part leisurely, and their fingers lightly tap ("指轻啄"), hinting at playful and intimate gestures.

The poet sighs, lamenting that spring is fading and the flowers are gradually aging ("欲叹春残花渐老"). However, they then note that summer is in full bloom, and the dark shirt ("皂衫") is thin ("薄"), suggesting the lightness and transparency of the garment in the summer heat. The lover's jade-like skin ("玉肌") emits a fragrance that permeates the soft, gauzy fabric ("软烟罗").

<h2>青玉案·江楼对影</h2>
<p class="heti-verse">
江楼对影相酌晚 雨暗洒 江波乱。<br>
愁至浓时嫌酒淡 湘妃泪尽 啼猿肠断 独醉清江畔。<br>
忽唤醒暮莺啼颤 乘杏风烟霭摧散。<br>
汀芷香侵杨柳岸 春宵月好 良辰休叹 但恨更香短。

In the poem "Qing Yu An" (青玉案), the author expresses deep sorrow and loneliness while drinking alone in a river tower, reflecting on the passing of time and the fleetingness of life. As evening approaches, the poet drinks with their own reflection ("江楼对影相酌晚"). The rain falls faintly ("雨暗洒"), and the river waves are turbulent ("江波乱"), mirroring the poet's troubled state of mind.

When the sorrow becomes too intense, even the wine tastes bland ("愁至浓时嫌酒淡"). The poet alludes to the legend of the "Xiang Fei" (湘妃, the goddess of the Xiang River), whose tears were exhausted, emphasizing the depth of their own grief as they drink alone by the clear river ("独醉清江畔").

Suddenly, the evening oriole's trembling song awakens the poet ("忽唤醒暮莺啼颤"). They seize the moment as the fragrance of the river's angelica permeates the willow banks ("汀芷香侵杨柳岸"), and the moon is beautiful on this spring night ("春宵月好"). The poet urges themselves not to sigh over this wonderful moment ("良辰休叹") but laments that the enchanting time is too short ("但恨更香短").

<h2>细胞礼赞</h2>
<p class="heti-verse">
问曰：<br>
太古之初，谁醒唤之？生命未形，何以始之？<br>
新生偶现，何能续之？寒武之爆，孰营度之？<br>
鹤游云山，何物载之？鱼翔河海，何灵动之？<br>
巨象之躯，何主塑之？地龙何德，断则又育？<br>
珊瑚丛丛，何以窴之？雀鸟何鸣？走兽何行？<br>
何以春生？何以秋成？角何所生？鳞何所长？<br>
万物灵长，何开而明？泱泱人世，其谁依焉？<br>
对曰：<br>
惟细胞也。<br>
遂赞曰：<br>
观渺渺兮其形，赐尊名兮细胞。<br>
塑核酸兮遗传，合蛋白兮予力。<br>
线粒体兮产能，溶酶体兮自噬。<br>
膜蛋白兮受命，外泌体兮传音。<br>
观皓腕兮上皮，洒赤血兮结缔。<br>
力拔山兮肌肉，闻楚歌兮神经。<br>
又叹曰：<br>
众生之美兮皆细胞，纵登太一兮难尽颂。

The poem "Xi Bao Li Zan" (细胞礼赞) is a reverent ode to the cell, the fundamental unit of life. The author poses a series of questions about the origins and mysteries of life, asking who awakened life at the beginning of time ("太古之初，谁醒唤之"), how life began before it took shape, and what sustains the emergence of new life. The poet wonders about the Cambrian explosion ("寒武之爆") and what guides the flight of cranes and the swimming of fish.

The author marvels at the force that shapes the bodies of giant elephants and the power of earthworms to regenerate when cut. They ponder the formation of coral reefs and the activities of birds and beasts.

The answer to all these questions, the author asserts, is the cell ("惟细胞也"). The poet then proceeds to praise the cell, marveling at its tiny form and bestowing upon it a noble name. The cell is lauded for shaping DNA for inheritance, combining proteins for strength, generating energy in mitochondria, and self-digesting in lysosomes.

Finally, the author exclaims that the beauty of all living beings lies in their cells ("众生之美兮皆细胞") and that even the greatest praise cannot fully capture their wonder.
