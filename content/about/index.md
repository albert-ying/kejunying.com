Hello! I'm a postdoc fellow at [Stanford University](https://med.stanford.edu/) in [Tony Wyss-Coray's lab](https://wyss-coray.stanford.edu/) and [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) in [David Baker's lab](https://www.bakerlab.org/), supported by an F99K00 fellowship. I recently received my Ph.D. from [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/) in [Vadim Gladyshev's lab](https://gladyshevlab.bwh.harvard.edu/). My research merges aging biology with protein design to tackle neurodegeneration. My recent work includes building [the first causal biomarker of aging](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-023-00557-0) and [ClockBase](https://clockbase.org) ([preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.28.530532v1)), which provides biological age estimates for over 2.5 million samples. I'm focused on building the next generation of therapeutics through **machine learning** and **protein design**.

The website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). The theme is adapted from the works by [Daniel Roelfs](https://danielroelfs.github.io) and Matthew Butterick.
