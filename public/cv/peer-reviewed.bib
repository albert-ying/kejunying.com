  abstract = {Abstract             Mitochondrial disease describes multiple pathologies characterized by a wide array of disease symptoms and severity, caused by mitochondrial dysfunction in one or multiple organs. Aging organisms display a similar variety of disease phenotypes, which are often characterized by mitochondrial impairment. Despite the heterogeneity of aging phenotypes, several interventions have been identified which can increase lifespan and delay the onset of age-related diseases in multiple organisms. Two age-delaying interventions, rapamycin and acarbose, dramatically suppress pathology in a mouse model of mitochondrial disease caused by depletion of the NADH-Ubiquinone Oxidoreductase Complex (Ndufs4-/-). This model recapitulates human Leigh syndrome, a childhood mitochondrial disease. Upon treatment with either drug, disease suppression is accompanied by a remodeling of nutrient metabolism and restoration of the NAD+/NADH ratio in the brain without affecting the electron transport chain. Thus, we propose that metabolic derangements induced by mitochondrial dysfunction may be a shared mechanism of aging and mitochondrial disease.},

  abstract = {Mitochondrial diseases represent a spectrum of disorders caused by impaired mitochondrial function, ranging in severity from mortality during infancy to progressive adult-onset disease. Mitochondrial dysfunction is also recognized as a molecular hallmark of the biological ageing process. Rapamycin, a drug that increases lifespan and health during normative ageing, also increases survival and reduces neurological symptoms in a mouse model of the severe mitochondrial disease Leigh syndrome. The Ndufs4 knockout (Ndufs4-/-) mouse lacks the complex I subunit NDUFS4 and shows rapid onset and progression of neurodegeneration mimicking patients with Leigh syndrome. Here we show that another drug that extends lifespan and delays normative ageing in mice, acarbose, also suppresses symptoms of disease and improves survival of Ndufs4-/- mice. Unlike rapamycin, acarbose rescues disease phenotypes independently of inhibition of the mechanistic target of rapamycin. Furthermore, rapamycin and acarbose have additive effects in delaying neurological symptoms and increasing maximum lifespan in Ndufs4-/- mice. We find that acarbose remodels the intestinal microbiome and alters the production of short-chain fatty acids. Supplementation with tributyrin, a source of butyric acid, recapitulates some effects of acarbose on lifespan and disease progression, while depletion of the endogenous microbiome in Ndufs4-/- mice appears to fully recapitulate the effects of acarbose on healthspan and lifespan in these animals. To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence that alteration of the gut microbiome plays a significant role in severe mitochondrial disease and provides further support for the model that biological ageing and severe mitochondrial disorders share underlying common mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Abstract           While cancer is an age-related disease, many cancer studies utilize younger animal models. Here, we uncover how a cancer, B-cell lymphoma, develops as a consequence of a naturally aged system. We show that this malignancy is associated with increased cell size, splenomegaly, and a newly discovered age-associated clonal B-cell (ACBC) population. Driven by exogenous c-Myc activation, hypermethylated promoters and somatic mutations, ACBC cells clonally expand independent of germinal centers (IgM+) and show increased biological age and hypomethylation in partially methylated domains related to mitotic solo-CpGs. Epigenetic changes in transformed mouse B cells are enriched for changes observed in human B-cell lymphomas. Mechanistically, the data suggest that cancerous ACBC cells originate from age-associated B cells, in part involving CD22 protein signaling fostered by the aging microenvironment. Transplantation assays demonstrate that ACBC evolve to become self-sufficient and support malignancy when transferred into young recipients. Inhibition of mTOR or c-Myc in old mice attenuates premalignant changes in B cells during aging and emerges as a therapeutic strategy to delay the onset of age-related lymphoma. Together, we show how aging contributes to B-cell lymphoma through a previously unrecognized mechanism involving cell-intrinsic changes and the aged microenvironment, characterize a model that captures the origin and progression of spontaneous cancer during aging and identify candidate interventions against age-associated lymphoma.},

  abstract = {Epigenetic `clocks' based on DNA methylation have emerged as the most robust and widely used aging biomarkers, but conventional methods for applying them are expensive and laborious. Here we develop tagmentation-based indexing for methylation sequencing (TIME-seq), a highly multiplexed and scalable method for low-cost epigenetic clocks. Using TIME-seq, we applied multi-tissue and tissue-specific epigenetic clocks in over 1,800 mouse DNA samples from eight tissue and cell types. We show that TIME-seq clocks are accurate and robust, enriched for polycomb repressive complex 2-regulated loci, and benchmark favorably against conventional methods despite being up to 100-fold less expensive. Using dietary treatments and gene therapy, we find that TIME-seq clocks reflect diverse interventions in multiple tissues. Finally, we develop an economical human blood clock (R\,{$>$}\,0.96, median error\,=\,3.39 years) in 1,056 demographically representative individuals. These methods will enable more efficient epigenetic clock measurement in larger-scale human and animal studies.},

We introduce a unified modelling technique that can consistently provide a total genetic contribution assessment (TGCA) of a gene or genetic variant without thresholding genetic association signals. Genome-wide TGCA in five UK Biobank phenotype domains highlights loci such as the               HLA               locus for medical conditions, the bone mineral density locus               WNT16               for physical measures, and the skin tanning locus               MC1R               and smoking behaviour locus               CHRNA3               for lifestyle. Tissue-specificity investigation reveals several tissues associated with total genetic contributions, including the brain tissues for mental health. Such associations are driven by tissue-specific gene expressions, which share genetic basis with the total genetic contributions. TGCA can provide a genome-wide atlas for the overall genetic contributions in each particular domain of human complex traits.},

Here, we perform metabolic methyl-labeling experiments to track the heritable transmission of methylation from ancestors to their descendants in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C.~elegans). We find heritable methylation in DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids. We find that parental starvation elicits reduced fertility, increased heat stress resistance, and extended longevity in fed, na{\"i}ve progeny. This intergenerational hormesis is accompanied by a heritable increase in N6'-dimethyl adenosine (m6,2A) on the 18S ribosomal RNA at adenosines 1735 and 1736. We identified DIMT-1/DIMT1 as the m6,2A and BUD-23/BUD23 as the m7G methyltransferases in C.~elegans that are both required for intergenerational hormesis, while other rRNA methyltransferases are dispensable. This study labels and tracks heritable non-genetic material across generations and demonstrates the importance of rRNA methylation for regulating epigenetic inheritance.},

  abstract = {Age-related changes in DNA methylation (DNAm) form the basis for the development of most robust predictors of age, epigenetic clocks, but a clear mechanistic basis for what exactly they quantify is lacking. Here, to clarify the nature of epigenetic aging, we analyzed the aging dynamics of bulk-tissue and single-cell DNAm, together with single-cell DNAm changes during early development. We show that aging DNAm changes are widespread, but are relatively slow and small in amplitude, with DNAm levels trending towards intermediate values and showing increased heterogeneity with age. By considering dominant types of DNAm changes, we find that aging manifests in the exponential decay-like loss or gain of methylation with a universal rate, independent of the initial level of DNAm. We further show that aging is dominated by the stochastic component, yet co-regulated changes are also present during both development and adulthood. We support the finding of stochastic epigenetic aging by direct single-cell DNAm analyses and modeling of aging DNAm trajectories with a stochastic process akin to radiocarbon decay. Finally, we describe a single-cell algorithm for the identification of co-regulated CpG clusters that may provide new opportunities for targeting aging and evaluating longevity interventions.},

  abstract = {Background:               SARS-CoV-2, the causal agent of COVID-19, enters human cells using the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) protein as a receptor. ACE2 is thus key to the infection and treatment of the coronavirus. ACE2 is highly expressed in the heart and respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, playing important regulatory roles in the cardiovascular and other biological systems. However, the genetic basis of the ACE2 protein levels is not well understood.                                         Methods:               We have conducted the largest genome-wide association meta-analysis of plasma ACE2 levels in {$>$}28\,000 individuals of the SCALLOP Consortium (Systematic and Combined Analysis of Olink Proteins). We summarize the cross-sectional epidemiological correlates of circulating ACE2. Using the summary statistics--based high-definition likelihood method, we estimate relevant genetic correlations with cardiometabolic phenotypes, COVID-19, and other human complex traits and diseases. We perform causal inference of soluble ACE2 on vascular disease outcomes and COVID-19 severity using mendelian randomization. We also perform in silico functional analysis by integrating with other types of omics data.                                         Results:                                We identified 10 loci, including 8 novel, capturing 30\% of the heritability of the protein. We detected that plasma ACE2 was genetically correlated with vascular diseases, severe COVID-19, and a wide range of human complex diseases and medications. An X-chromosome cis--protein quantitative trait loci--based mendelian randomization analysis suggested a causal effect of elevated ACE2 levels on COVID-19 severity (odds ratio, 1.63 [95\% CI, 1.10--2.42];                 P                 =0.01), hospitalization (odds ratio, 1.52 [95\% CI, 1.05--2.21];                 P                 =0.03), and infection (odds ratio, 1.60 [95\% CI, 1.08--2.37];                 P                 =0.02). Tissue- and cell type--specific transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis revealed that the ACE2 regulatory variants were enriched for DNA methylation sites in blood immune cells.                                                        Conclusions:               Human plasma ACE2 shares a genetic basis with cardiovascular disease, COVID-19, and other related diseases. The genetic architecture of the ACE2 protein is mapped, providing a useful resource for further biological and clinical studies on this coronavirus receptor.},

Methods               We conducted a multi-instrument Mendelian Randomization analysis of multiple lifespan-related traits and COVID-19. Aging clock models were applied to the subjects with different COVID-19 conditions in the UK-Biobank cohort. We performed a bivariate genomic scan for age-related COVID-19 and Mendelian Randomization analysis of 389 immune cell traits to investigate their effect on lifespan and COVID-19 risk.                                         Results                                We show that the genetic variation that supports longer life is significantly associated with the lower risk of COVID-19 infection and hospitalization.

We detect an association between biological age acceleration and future incidence and severity of COVID-19 infection. Genetic profiling of age-related COVID-19 infection indicates key contributions of Notch signaling and immune system development. We reveal a negative correlation between the effects of immune cell traits on lifespan and COVID-19 risk. We find that lower B-cell CD19 levels are indicative of an increased risk of COVID-19 and decreased life expectancy, which is further validated by COVID-19 clinical data.

  abstract = {Identifying and validating biomarkers of aging is pivotal for understanding the aging process and testing longevity interventions. Despite the development of numerous aging biomarkers, their clinical validation remains elusive, largely due to the lack of cross-population validation, which is hampered by disparate biomarker designs and inconsistencies in dataset structures. To bridge this gap, we introduce Biolearn, an innovative open-source library dedicated to the implementation and application of aging biomarkers. Biolearn facilitates (1) harmonization of existing aging biomarkers, while presenting a structured framework for novel biomarkers in standardized formats; (2) unification of public datasets, ensuring coherent structuring and formatting, thus simplifying cross-population validation studies; and (3) provision of computational methodologies to assess any harmonized biomarker against unified datasets. By furnishing a community-driven platform, Biolearn significantly augments the development, assessment, and validation trajectories of aging biomarkers, paving the way toward more rigorous clinical validation and, ultimately, application in clinical trials targeting healthy longevity. The Biolearn package is open-source and freely available at https://Bio-Learn.github.io/},

  abstract = {Machine learning models based on DNA methylation data can predict biological age but often lack causal insights. By harnessing large-scale genetic data through epigenome-wide Mendelian randomization, we identified CpG sites potentially causal for aging-related traits. Neither the existing epigenetic clocks nor age-related differential DNA methylation are enriched in these sites. These CpGs include sites that contribute to aging and protect against it, yet their combined contribution negatively affects age-related traits. We established a new framework to introduce causal information into epigenetic clocks, resulting in DamAge and AdaptAge---clocks that track detrimental and adaptive methylation changes, respectively. DamAge correlates with adverse outcomes, including mortality, while AdaptAge is associated with beneficial adaptations. These causality-enriched clocks exhibit sensitivity to short-term interventions. Our findings provide a detailed landscape of CpG sites with putative causal links to lifespan and healthspan, facilitating the development of aging biomarkers, assessing interventions, and studying reversibility of age-associated changes.},

  abstract = {Recent studies suggest the existence of a natural rejuvenation event during early embryonic development of mice, followed by epigenetic aging. Here, by profiling embryonic DNA methylation in the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, we found that the epigenetic entropy basepoint maps to the gastrulation stage of embryogenesis and corresponds to a rapid increase in embryo transcript abundance. We further developed a frog aging clock, revealing that this species epigenetically ages. Application of this clock to developmental stages identified a decrease in epigenetic age during early embryogenesis, with the minimal age reached around gastrulation. By examining individual developmental trajectories of 6,457 embryos, we found that this stage is also accompanied by a higher incidence of disrupted development. Taken together, our data point to gastrulation as a critical stage for aging and natural rejuvenation, characterized by the lowest epigenetic age, increased mortality, nadir of DNA methylation entropy and rapid increase in embryo transcript abundance, defining aging ground zero as the basepoint where rejuvenation ends and the aging process begins.},
