If you imagine all the hypotheses and analyses you could pursue right now as a graph, each one a node, with edges representing how one result enables or changes another, then research taste is something like the ability to find the node (or small module) that would affect the largest number of other nodes.</description></item><item><title>Contact &amp; About</title><link>/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/about/</guid><description>Contact keying@stanford.edu kying0@uw.edu @kejunying LinkedIn Google Scholar GitHub Office: 290 Jane Stanford Way, Stanford, CA 94305
About Kejun Ying, postdoctoral researcher studying aging systems biology at Stanford University (Wyss-Coray lab) and Institute for Protein Design (Baker lab), NIH/NIA K00 fellow. Dr. Ying completed his Ph.D. in Biology (2025) and M.S. in Computational Science &amp;amp; Engineering (2024) from Harvard University in Dr. Vadim Gladyshev&amp;rsquo;s lab. His contributions include developing the first causal inference-based aging clock (Nature Aging cover, 2024), creating ClockBase (preprint) &amp;ndash; a platform integrating over two million biological age data highlighted in Nature Biotechnology News &amp;ndash; and developing MethylGPT, recognized in Science by Eric Topol as among the most promising biomedical large models.</description></item><item><title>Curriculum Vitae</title><link>/cv/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/cv/</guid><description>Download the PDF version.</description></item><item><title>Poetry</title><link>/poetry/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poetry/</guid><description>All notes are generated by AI 后庭花破子·冬夜偶提 寒星久靡靡，游烛漫欲熄。

九年寻觅，待何日，方可医？ 墨尘子 癸卯年 十一月 廿四 The poem "Hou Ting Hua Po Zi" (后庭花破子) expresses the author's melancholy and despair as he reflects on the passing of time and the challenges of aging on a cold winter night. The fading starlight ("寒星") and flickering candle ("游烛") symbolize the waning of life.
