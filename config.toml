I'm a postdoctoral fellow at [Stanford University](https://med.stanford.edu/) in [Tony Wyss-Coray's lab](https://wyss-coray.stanford.edu/) and [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) in [David Baker's lab](https://www.bakerlab.org/), supported by an NIH/NIA F99K00 fellowship. I earned my Ph.D. in Biological Sciences from [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/) (2025) in [Vadim Gladyshev's lab](https://gladyshevlab.bwh.harvard.edu/) and an M.Sc. in Computational Science and Engineering from [Harvard SEAS](https://seas.harvard.edu/) (2024). My research merges aging biology with **protein design** to tackle neurodegeneration, focusing on the causes of aging, epigenetics, metabolism, and multi-omics. I'm building the next generation of therapeutics through **machine learning** and **protein design**. "
